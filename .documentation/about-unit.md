## About the Garrett County Population Health, Innovation, & Informatics Unit

A critical step in improving health in any community is to develop pathways for
community members and partner organizations to contribute to the planning
decisions that affect them. Realizing the field of public health lacked ways to
conduct and track true community engagement, we adopted the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation’s definition of equity that “everyone has a fair and just
opportunity to be as healthy as possible*”- then we focused on removing
obstacles. In the simplest of terms, we opened up the process and created a
pathway by improving access to health improvement processes and made it a lot
easier for people to participate by going digital. We created the first and only
dynamic, open source solution that enables communities to create a shared
vision based upon data to meaningfully engage the community.

As a successful grantee of the 21st Century Innovators cohort from PHNCI, a
division of PHAB, with support from RWJF, we are excited to share our expertise in
this guide with communities everywhere that are working diligently to improve
health.
