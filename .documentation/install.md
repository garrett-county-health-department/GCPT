## Ok, I’m ready, let’s install the GCPT!

### Step 1 - Installing WordPress

Since WordPress is the most popular Content Management System on the Internet,
it’s no surprise that there are literally THOUSANDS of installation tutorials! In fact,
WordPress has been so refined over the years, that it’s become famous for its
well-known 5-minute installation.

For practicality, this section of the installation guide links to a variety of simple,
instructional articles and videos for different learning styles. Pick the one that works
best for you and proceed to the next step.

### Step 2 - Installing Dependencies

Now that you’ve installed WordPress, it’s time to install the BuddyPress framework.
BuddyPress enhances membership capabilities for your website, and enables the
use of GCPT plugins, such as the strategy and raw data modules.

To get started, navigate to the “Plugins” tab in your WordPress administrative portal
(yoursite.com/wp-admin), and click “Add New."

This is the Add Plugins page for WordPress that will enable you to install the
dependencies for the GCPT, the GCPT itself, as well as extend your community
platform with over 50,000 potential plugins, most of which are free to use!

Type BuddyPress into the “Search plugins” box shown above in the upper right
corner, to search the WordPress repository for the most recent version of this core
user plugin.

Once your search loads, click “Install Now” to install the BuddyPress dependencies.
Once the installation is complete, the button will change to say “Activate.” Click
“Activate”, and the plugin will begin setting up the necessary database files, and
prepare you to install the GCPT.

### Step 3 - Configuring BuddyPress

In order to use the free, open source Garrett County Planning Tool (GCPT)
plugins, you’ll need to activate BuddyPress groups. This feature of the BuddyPress
framework allows your users to be organized into groups and provides a space for
the GCPT plugins to work their magic. To enable BuddyPress groups, navigate to
“Settings” -> “BuddyPress” in your WordPress administration panel (yoursite.com/wp-admin).

Ensure that the “User Groups” checkbox is active, and optionally select any other 
features that you may desire.

Note, we recommend leaving private messages turned off as a spam and
community control mechanism to prevent anyone from utilizing your platform for
other purposes, such as solicitations, mass user mailings, etc…

### Step 4 - Install the GCPT

Now, repeat the same steps, going to the WordPress plugin page, clicking "Add New,"
and searching for the Garrett County Planning Tool or GCPT. Then click "Install,"
and finally click "Activate" after the installation completes.

### Step 5 - Configuring the GCPT

It’s finally time to start customizing your Planning Tool for
your own community! To get started, head to the options page named “GCPT” in the 
WordPress administrative panel (a new option in the left sidebar that appears after 
installing the GCPT Manager Plugin), and fill out as much information about your 
community as possible.

Performance note, as your site grows, remember this panel. Many of these options,
such as number of measures, tags, etc… can assist in performance if you end up
with a viral hit on your hands.

Garrett County’s pilot started with 3 measures, then 5, then 10, and finally the full
15.

This enabled us to grow confidently, and worry less about large traffic spikes
caused by highly effective marketing campaigns.

### Step 6 - Extending the GCPT

Congratulations! Your Garrett County Planning Tool (GCPT) is ready to go! We

you’re starting to improve the health outcomes for everyone in your community.
