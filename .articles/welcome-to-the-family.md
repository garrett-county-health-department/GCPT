## Welcome to the growing GCPT Family!

### Stay True to the original intent, improve equity .

Opening up and welcoming people regardless of their agency
affiliation, status, ability to utilize transportation, etc., increases equity
in health planning/improvement processes and cultivates an inclusive
culture aiding in the sustainability of meaningful health improvements.

### Invite Agency Stakeholders to be transparent.

The collaborative workspaces, known as Action Groups can be
accessed anytime and encourages partners to measure their work on
a specific strategy both individually and collectively. This creates a
strong sense of accountability and helps to foster trust within a
