## Action Plan For Agency Readiness

### Coordinating Resources for Effective Population Health Planning

As you evaluate all the options available to you as you seek to engage with your
community in a more meaningful way, increase accountability by collecting and
reporting hyper local data measures, and build trust through transparency, there
are several considerations we invite you to think about before you begin.

### Action Plan for Agency Readiness Scores

With a score of at least 7 or more, approach this venture with confidence that
you’ve got what it takes to make the implementation of the GCPT successful in your
community!

However, if your community scores either 5 or 6, implementing the GCPT may be
exactly what your community needs. Sometimes offering something different is all
it takes to bring community champions forward, or begin conversations about
topics that haven’t previously been discussed. More effort will be necessary for
successful implementation, but overcoming barriers are what helps us grow. So
think outside the box, seek a fresh perspective, and dig in!

If your score is less than 4, it may be difficult to successfully utilize the GCPT
in your community at this time. However, with the right team, a few critical resources, 
and the desire to improve equity, anything is possible!

Before we get into the technical install, let’s think about where people are
going to access your platform. Whether you're doing this on your own or working
with a technical team, you’ll need to have a good idea of what you want your
domain name to be before you start the process.

### What’s in a name?

Choosing your domain name carefully with inclusion at the forefront is a critical
piece to the success of your efforts. It’s unlikely that the community or other agency
stakeholders will feel ownership of the platform if it’s buried in an organization's
existing website. A name that is reflective of the purpose and is easy to remember
is a great place to begin.

### Collaboration: A Fresh Perspective

You’ve already identified the person who will champion this effort in the “Readiness
Exercise”. The highest performing GCPT implementers have an attitude of service
and are eager to invite both the community and agency stakeholders to share what
matters to them by conveying the benefits of the platform and meeting them
where they are! Traditional approaches to engagement and the notion of “setting
the table” aren't recommended. However, pulling up a chair to their table and
fostering meaningful relationships that will be reflected on the Planning Tool is the
essence of true community engagement that can be beautifully demonstrated on
your installation just as it is in Garrett County, MD, home of the GCPT family.

### Community Champions

There are many resources that help us think about the ways we define and engage
with our community. A collaboration between the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute published a
learning guide titled, Partnering with Residents-Getting Started*.

We suggest identifying a minimum of three active community champions as early in
the process as possible to ensure everything from concept design to continued
implementation of the GCPT is tightly woven with an active community presence
that will improve organic sustainability of the work.

### Foundations of the Action Groups within your GCPT

What matters most to people will be the basis of the action groups that create
mobilization within your community. It’s here that you’ll gather both qualitative and
quantitative data around the topics that are of greatest interest in your community.
It’s helpful to work with your community champions to build a content framework
for a few action groups before launch to use as a model as your process begins.

### Pick a date and stick to it

Going “LIVE” and actually launching the site is more difficult than you might
imagine. The installation of the GCPT has been the primary focus, but the Planning
Tool needs to come to life! As we guided five diverse communities through an initial
replication pilot, reassurance in their processes and coaching to maintain the
original intent of the Planning Tool made it easier to commit. It takes serious
vulnerability to put your work out for the world to see. There always seems to be
something to tweak or another plug-in that may improve the user experience, but
at some point, you need to trust your work and push the button. That’s why
choosing a date ahead of time and strictly following your project timeline is
recommended to launch within a reasonable timeframe.

### Marketing, Marketing, Marketing...

Now that you’ve launched your brand new Planning Tool on a website, how will
people find it? The answer depends largely on how dedicated your implementation
coordinators are and how engaged the community champions become. We
recommend a top down and bottom up approach simultaneously in the coalition
and agency stakeholder meeting rounds, offering live demos and how-to sessions.
A marketing budget never hurts, running social media ads, equipping your site with
social integrations, utilizing email marketing, and responding quickly on the
platform increases engagement.
