## What is WordPress/BuddyPress?

WordPress is the world’s most popular Content Management System (CMS), and
now powers over 30% of the entire Internet*! Content Management Systems allow
end-users, just like you, to easily update and edit website content without knowing
any code or specialized technological skills.

The Garrett County Planning Tool is a community engagement framework
that includes WordPress plugins that extend a major component plugin called
BuddyPress.

BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin that allows your community
members to create accounts, to be grouped into categories, and to have custom
profiles. The Garrett County Planning Tool plugins further enhance these
functions with many, many tools specifically designed for Public Health and
community engagement – these include hyper local data collections, health
improvement strategy development and endless ways to engage and track your
community’s health improvement efforts.
