## What do I need to get started?

Generating a GCPT installation is quick and easy with most shared web hosting
providers, but can generally run on any general LAMP, LEMP, or other web server
stack. Unlike many public health tools, the GCPT is self-hosted, which means that
you own your data, and can move or modify your installation at any time, and scale
your platform as it grows.

Many shared web hosting providers even offer 1-click installations of WordPress
(the primary platform upon which the GCPT is built), allowing you to be ready to
install the GCPT in less than 5 minutes.

For those that are unfamiliar with web hosting, the process is very easy and
generally goes as follows:

1. Sign up for a shared web hosting provider.
2. Purchase a domain name (i.e.; mygarrettcounty.com) - this can usually be
done through your web host for convenience if you do not have a preferred
registrar.
3. Point your domain name at your web host - usually not necessary if you
purchase your domain with your web host.
4. Use Softaculous (or a similar 1-click installation wizard, if available) to install
WordPress, or download WordPress from https://wordpress.org/download/ .
5. Install the GCPT dependencies as directed in this tutorial.
6. Install the GCPT platform.
7. Customize your GCPT, and launch your community collaborative!

While this process may vary by web host, it generally takes 10-45 minutes,
depending on experience.
